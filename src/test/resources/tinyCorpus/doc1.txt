At least 19 people were killed and 114 people were wounded in
Tuesday's southern Philippines airport blast, officials said, but
reports said the death toll could climb to 30.

Radio station DXDC placed the death toll at 30, without giving a
source for the figure, which officials could not immediately confirm.

The Davao Medical Center, a regional government hospital, recorded 19
deaths with 50 wounded. Medical evacuation workers however said the
injured list was around 114, spread out at various hospitals.

A powerful bomb tore through a waiting shed at the Davao City
international airport at about 5.15 pm (0915 GMT) while another
explosion hit a bus terminal at the city. There were no reports of
injuries in the second blast.

"It's a very powerful bomb. The waiting shed literally exploded,"
said Vice Mayor Luis Bongoyan, speaking to local radio station

Television footage showed medical teams carting away dozens of
wounded victims with fully armed troops on guard.

Many of the victims were shown with hastily applied bandages, and
teams of nurses and doctors were seen in packed emergency rooms
attending to the wounded.
